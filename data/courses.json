It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer\\'s, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases.

We will approach childhood as an entryway into investigating debates surrounding transitional justice, armed conflict, migration, race, gender identity and illness to explore how child figures offer perspectives that challenge hegemonic discourses in Latin America. By examining the child’s relationship with the mysterious, frightening and inexplicable, we will explore childhood as an alternative mode of communication and a metaphorical state through which we can discuss recent political, social and literary histories.

The 1970s saw a global economy defined increasingly by deindustrialization, intensified competition, financialization, and squeezes on profitably. For workers, these changes meant that technological development, agrarian change, debt, and increasing precarity have transformed who works, where they work, and the sorts of politics that work (or its absence) gives rise to. This course examines these wider concerns within the context of the Middle East. Through a focus on social history and ethnographic accounts, it illuminates the ways different groups of workers experience and grapple with these broader transformations.']"

The course will motivate students to communicate both in written and spoken Persian by utilizing the adequate grammatical order and correct vocabulary. Prerequisite: PRSN\\xa00400.']"

But over the next 20 years, he brings them both back (in different ways), convinced that they both play a crucial role in our thinking.

Nimbly moving back and forth between disability studies and labor history, we will develop the conceptual tools to understand capitalism through the lens of disability, while also generating new ways to think about disability via critical histories of capitalism.

This seminar tackles these questions by exploring stories of nature from various epistemic traditions. Through ten case studies, we will investigate how the human-nonhuman boundary has been expressed through storytelling in creation myths, natural histories, fiction and journalistic writing, documentaries, and artistic creations. Methodologically, we will survey how scholars have reflected on this boundary from the history of science, animal studies and indigenous studies, while learning to write stories of nature of our own.

The second section of the course will contend with the recent rise of Proud Boys, Identity Europa, and the rise of the far-right in Eastern Europe through the lens of performance studies to understand the procedures of identification and aesthetics that lead to white supremacy.']"

While the indivisible heritage referred to in this context reflects the reality of Jerusalem’s Old City’s intertwined historical, cultural, and religious legacies, it does not address the geopolitical conflict, in which ideological and territorial claims produce diverging heritage narratives. In this seminar, we will examine how competing heritage narratives have been shaped by Israeli, Palestinian, and international views and interests.

After some foundational studies, the semester will be spent immersed in a team research project. Topics may include evictions, studentification and gentrification, rental inspections, property ownership, and healthy housing. The course will advance skills in research, communication, and collaboration, and expand understanding of the housing system.']"
